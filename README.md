# 1D-Frogger
KiCAD project files for a minimalist one dimensional game of Frogger

See BOM for components and assembly notes

How to play the game:
* Press the button while the light is green to advance Frogger until you reach the final light.
* If you press it while it's red, Frogger goes back to the starting position.
* The flashing will be faster and faster, so act quickly!
* The difficulty can be adjusted by shorting the J4 pins with a jumper (faster flashing).
